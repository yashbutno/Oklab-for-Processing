## Oklab for Processing.

Translated (with added functions) by Yash Gupta to Processing code, from the file ['colorconversion.js' on GitHub](https://github.com/bottosson/bottosson.github.io/blob/master/misc/colorpicker/colorconversion.js) by [Björn Ottosson](https://bottosson.github.io/).

![Oklab for Processing](../master/images/oklab-for-processing-title.png)

Perceptually-accurate and human-friendly color picking using the Oklab color space.

This library includes a small collection of functions to help you pick colors with perceptual accuracy using Björn Ottosson's Oklab color space. This works in contrast to generating colors using RGB or HSB values, in which similar difference in input values don't represent similar difference in color output.

## How to install Oklab for Processing

### Install with the Contribution Manager

Add contributed Libraries by selecting the menu item _Sketch_ → _Import Library..._ → _Add Library..._ This will open the Contribution Manager, where you can browse for Oklab for Processing, or any other Library you want to install.

Not all available Libraries have been converted to show up in this menu. If a Library isn't there, it will need to be installed manually by following the instructions below.

### Manual Install

Contributed Libraries may be downloaded separately and manually placed within the `libraries` folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder: 
  * For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `~/Documents/Processing` 
  * For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `My Documents/Processing`

Download Oklab for Processing from https://github.com/yashbutno/Oklab-for-Processing

Unzip and copy the contributed Library's folder into the `libraries` folder in the Processing sketchbook. You will need to create this `libraries` folder if it does not exist.

The folder structure for Library Oklab for Processing should be as follows:

```
Processing
  libraries
    Oklab for Processing
      examples
      library
        Oklab for Processing.jar
      reference
      src
```
             
Some folders like `examples` or `src` might be missing. After Library Oklab for Processing has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, have a look at the [Processing Wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) for more information, or contact the author [Yash Gupta](https://github.com/yashbutno).
